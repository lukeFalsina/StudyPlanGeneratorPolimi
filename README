1. INTRODUCTION
##################################################################################
The aim of this collection of files is helping students from the Master
degree in "Engineering of Computing Systems" A.A. 2014/2015
in picking the best suitable courses to add to their study plan. 
Since there a couple of constraints that should be respected and students may 
have some courses that are forbidden or mandatory or may want to balance
the effort among the semesters, the hope is that this piece of software may
help them to find a suitable study plan which fulfills all their constraints.
Actually this model may be expanded to any general university degree as long 
as one is patient enough to fulfill the data file used by the model with
the courses and constraints of his/her degree :)
All the files in this folder can be freely modified and changed as long as 
the authorship is not claimed.
I also invite to drop me an email at lfalsina@gmail.com if you have any kind
of comments, suggestions, criticisms or improvements..
Please also remember that this is just an indicative tool and so compare the 
suggested result with the official degree program is strongly encouraged!
(especially since timetables of the different courses are not evaluated by
this model and so lessons from the resulting picked courses may overlap).

2. FEATURES
##################################################################################
After having properly set the data file (see section 3.) this program is 
able to generate and store in a .txt file an optimal study plan that fulfills
all the constraints and your personal interests. In particular you can set:
- The liking of each course with an integer score from 1 to 5 
[ 1: I do not want to take this course at all (except if it's mandatory), 
  5: I'll love to attend this course ].
- The possibility to attend a specific course (some courses may be forbidden
or on the other hand mandatory for you..)
- The selection of courses that are only taught in English [ a particularly nice
feature for foreign students :) ]
- The overall amount of credits between the different semesters (if you know
that you want to work on your thesis during the last 2nd semester you can 
asks to the solver for more courses during the 1st semesters and less on the 2nd)
- The minimum and maximum amount of credits that you need to obtain before the 
degree [ maybe you would like to take some extra courses as well :) Do not 
consider credits reserved for your master thesis while selecting these 
two parameters]
- And finally the minimum and maximum amount of credits for each courses group
(i.e. I need at least 15 CFU from INT1 and at most 5 CFU from DOT table..)

3. SETUP
##################################################################################
In order to make the system work you'll need to have installed on your 
machine the Python interpreter, AMPL and the solver lpsolve, plus performing
a bit of configuration on the data file to set your choices and needs.
This is a straightforward guide for Linux (Ubuntu) users but it should not
be that hard to adapt these steps for Windows users as well..

1. Install or check for Python interpreter availability.
	In a terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T) digit "sudo apt-get install python2.7" 
	and press "Enter". Insert your system admin password and then "Enter"
	again. If the packet needs to be installed, type "Y" and press "Enter"
	again; otherwise just move to step 2.

2. Install the tabulate module for Python
	In the terminal type "sudo pip install tabulate".

3. Check results
	In the terminal digit "pyton2.7", then when the interpreter is loaded
	type "from tabulate import tabulate". If no error message is shown, 
	everything went smooth. Press "Ctrl + D" to exit.

4. Retrieve AMPL executable and the solver lpsolve
	Check from the AMPL guidelines in the website 
	(http://www.ampl.com/DOWNLOADS/details.html) how to download and
	set up both AMPL and its solver lpsolve. A fine idea here for Linux
	users is moving both the file "ampl" and "lpsolve" into the "/bin"
	folder such that these programs can be always launched from the
	terminal without caring about the folder location.

5. Configure the data file according to your preferences
	In the current dir you can see a file called 
	"study_plan_standard_eng_computing_systems.dat". Here all preferences 
	and constraints can be set. This file is already filled with values
	that should be acceptable for the most part of the students (except for
	the liking parameter). For such a reason it's a good idea to
	keep a clean copy of this initial version of the file in case you
	will need to recompile preferences from scratch. After having 
	created a copy of the file, you can start modifying the section
	#PARAMS of the original	in several ways [WARNING: do not 
	modify the #SETS section but only the #PARAMS one]. Please notice
	that close to each parameter there is a brief explanation on how
	to modify the parameters and sometimes also an example of use, so
	I refer you to give a look directly at that .dat file :)

6. Enable constraint for only English-taught exams (for not-Italian speakers)
	By default the study plan generator will pick both courses that are
	taught in English and in Italian. Foreign students may prefer to insert
	only English taught courses. If this is the case, you have simply to uncomment
	this constraint by removing the # character at the beginning of the last
	line in the file "study_plan.mod" and then saving the updated version of the file.

7. Generate your study plan
	Finally it's time to generate your study plan :)
	To do so in a terminal reach this folder by typing
	"cd <your path to this folder>/StudyPlanGenerator".
	Then type "./gen_study_plan.sh study_plan.run" 
	Et voil√†! If your choices do not violate any of the
	constraints, your study plan is now saved in a table-like 
	format into the file "MyStudyPlan.txt".
	
	Please notice that if in step 5. you have created and edited
	a copy of the data file whose name is no longer the one of the 
	previous version, before generating the study plan you will 
	have to update the line "data" in file "study_plan.run" with 
	the new name of the .dat file.

4. GREETINGS
##################################################################################
That should be enough to start playing with the study plan generator.
If the resulting study plan do not satisfy you completely, you may play 
around and tune the different parameters (especially the liking one) 
till you reach a satisfying result :)
I hope you, students as I am, will appreciate this effort and won't hesitate
to contact me for any kind of suggestion..
Greetings and thanks for reading,
